# New Zealand Age/Case/Death extraction

# Date: 30 March 2020

* Data source: https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases/covid-19-current-cases-details (click on "download confirmed and probable case data"

* Version used for extraction saved as "NZL_MOH_<date>.csv: https://uwnetid-my.sharepoint.com/personal/pigottdm_uw_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?viewid=23e63e87%2Dfef6%2D4780%2D8985%2D4dbba2069603&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fpigottdm%5Fuw%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FCOVID%2D19%20Resource%20Hub%2FCFR%2Dage

## Indicators

* cases: Used the "Date of report", "Sex", and "Age group" column
* deaths: I extracted this on March 29th - at this time New Zealand had just reported it's first death - a woman in her 70s. Therefore, this column came from that. This extraction is less realistic to update given that as NZ gets more deaths, it will become much hard to look up age/sex details on the deaths
